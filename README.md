# Twitter Side Panel Implementation

A Swift implementation of Twitter's interactive side menu panel with realistic physics-based animations.

## Features

- Custom side menu panel with smooth animations
- Physics-based gesture interactions using damped harmonic spring
- Rubber-banding effect for natural interactions
- Interactive transitions with velocity-sensitive animations
- Twitter-style UI elements and layout

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The project is organized with a clear separation of concerns:

- **ApplicationUI**: Contains the main application flow controller and view
- **SideMenuUI**: Implements the side menu components and interaction logic
- **SwiftUtilities**: General Swift utility extensions and functions
- **UIKitUtilities**: UIKit-specific utilities for animations and gesture handling

### Key Components

#### Side Menu

The side menu is implemented as a collection view with a custom header. It includes:

- User profile information with avatar
- Following/Followers statistics
- Navigation items like Profile, Lists, Topics, etc.

#### Physics-Based Animations

The application uses realistic physics-based animations:

- `DampedHarmonicSpring`: Models spring physics for natural animations
- Rubber-banding: Provides resistance at the boundaries of motion
- Velocity-sensitive transitions: Menu follows the user's gesture velocity

#### Gesture Handling

The side panel can be revealed with a pan gesture that:

- Tracks translation and velocity
- Projects the final position based on gesture velocity
- Applies appropriate spring animations for completion

## Usage

The side menu can be accessed by swiping from the left edge of the screen. The animation will complete based on the velocity and distance of the gesture.

## Acknowledgments

The physics-based animations are inspired by Apple's WWDC sessions on fluid interfaces and incorporate concepts from real-world physics for natural-feeling interactions.
